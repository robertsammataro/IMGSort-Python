##IMGSort v1.2.1
Generate Simple Archives of Image Files!  
Build Date: 8 March 2021  

####Welcome to IMGSort, the simplest tool for creating image archives!

###How to use:
  - Before beginning, ensure that all files you wish to sort are in the same
    directory.

  - Upon launching IMGSort, navigate to the directory where the images to be
    sorted are located in the 'Input Directory Location' field

  - Navigate to the directory where you wish to form your archive in the
    'Output Directory Location' field

  - Select the file formats you wish to include. Currently IMGSort supports
    .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, and .bmp images.

  - If you wish to force all your sorted images to a certain size, enter the
    desired height and width in pixels in the boxes under 'Advanced Settings.'
    NOTE: The forced scaling will not be applied unless 'Override Original
    Scaling' is also selected

  - To delete images from the input directory as they are sorted, click the
    'Delete Original Image' box. If no destination tags are entered, the files
    will NOT be deleted (new to v1.2.1)

  - Click "Run" and a window will pop up displaying one image at a time. In the
    box at the bottom, enter the name of the subfolder in the Output Directory
    you would like to send the image to. You may enter multiple subfolders by
    separating tags with a comma or period. Leaving the field empty will skip over the
    displayed image.

###Tips and Shortcuts:  

  - Ending a list of tags with two commas, periods, or a combination of the two
    will result in a copy of the image being placed in the absolute path of the
    output directory  

###Troubleshooting:

**IMGSort will not launch**

Ensure that all assets are in the same folder as IMGSort.exe. These Files include:
- imgsort.ico
- logo.png
- question.png


**Some images not appearing in the display window**

Ensure the desired image is in a compatible file format and that the format
is selected on the main window upon launch.


###Changelog:

#### 8 March 2021:

    - Fixed a bug where filed extensions with upper case letters were not
      being recognized

    - Added feature where the original file will not be erased when no tags are
      entered, even if the 'Delete Original' option is selected

    - Removed tag checks that were originally added for testing and debugging

    - Removed default hard-coded file paths that were originally added for
      testing and debugging

    - Added if __name__ == "__main__": statement so that the script can be
      imported without immediately executing the GUI

    - Updated copyright information to 2020-2021

    - Reformatted README with better markdown and updated information

###Future Additions:
  - Feature where the user can add default Input and Output directories  
  - Feature where the user can send images to multiple folders with one tag  

###Known Bugs:  
  - If the user submits a series of tags including a character that cannot be
    used as a folder name on the tag entry screen, the program will crash.
